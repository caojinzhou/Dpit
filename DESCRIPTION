Description: Compares distributions with one another in terms of their fit to each sample in a dataset that contains multiple samples, as described in Joo, Aguinis, and Bradley (in press). Users can examine the fit of seven distributions per sample: pure power law, lognormal, exponential, power law with an exponential cutoff, normal, Poisson, and Weibull. Automation features allow the user to compare all distributions for all samples with a single command line, which creates a separate row containing results for each sample until the entire dataset has been analyzed.
